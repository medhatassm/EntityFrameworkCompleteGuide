### ORM System Type

- **Dapper**
    - minimal feature
    - easy to learn
    - macro / ORM

- **NHibernate**
    - Mature
    - Open Source
    - Fully Feature
- **Entity Framework core**
    - Light weight
    - open source
    - cross-platform
    - fully featured

## Advanced Of Entity Framework

- **Fully Flagged ORM**

- Light Weight
- Class Platform

- Open Source
- Extensible

## History Of .Net Framework Vs .Net Framework Core

### .Net Framework

| .Net FrameWork | Version |
| --- | --- |
| 2002 | 1.0 |
| 2005 | 2.0 |
| 2006 | 3.0 |
| ORM System Deploy | — |
| 2010 | 4.0 |
| 2012 | 4.5 |
| 2015 | 4.6 |

> .Net Framework have some issue like:
>
> - Not Open Source
> - Work on Windows Only
>
> So That microsoft work on new technology to solve this problem and called it **.Net FrameWork Core**
>

| .Net FrameWork Core | .Net Version | EF Core Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2016 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| 2017 | 2.0 | 2.0 |
| 2019 | 3.0 | 3.1 |
| 2020 | 5.0 | 5.0 |
| 2021 | 6.0 | 6.0 |
| 2022 | 7.0 | 7.0 |
| 2023 | 8.0 | 8.0 |
| 2024 | 9.0 | 9.0 |

> at 2020 microsoft change the name of **.Net Framework** core to **.Net** and stop support .Net Framework anymore, after that at 2022 they change **Entity Framework Core** Name to **Entity Framework**, and that make microsoft now work on cross platform and open source.
